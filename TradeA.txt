This project will deliver a fully-featured, enterprise-grade desktop application named DRN.today, designed to run seamlessly across all major operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS, with all processing occurring locally on the user's machine. It will contain no test code, no boilerplate, and absolutely no partial implementations. The architecture will be modular and pre-planned, with all folders, modules, and advanced features defined and developed independently from the start. The central main.py or dashboard entry point will act solely as a feature orchestrator, embedding modules without containing any business logic. Each module will be a self-contained unit, handling its own GUI, internal engine, state, error management, and persistence independently.

DRN.today will offer industry-leading capabilities not available in any existing commercial solution, particularly in the area of automated lead generation and outreach, including:

PyInstaller, Briefcase, or Nuitka for one-file or directory-based deployment
Includes all internal resources: plugins, templates, icons, and pretrained TinyBERT models
🧠 AI Lead Scoring Engine

ML models continuously evaluate leads based on 20+ signals using Scikit-learn and TinyBERT
Predicts conversion probability and campaign responsiveness
Allows automatic filtering or retargeting based on predicted value
🛒 Lead Pack Marketplace
